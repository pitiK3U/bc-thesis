% Introduce topic
This thesis improves the currently firmware for the connector of the \acrshort{rofi} platform.

% Background -- previous research
The \acrshort{rofi} platform is established in thesis of my advisor Jan Mrázek \cite{Mrazek2019thesis}. My advisor's thesis focuses on modeling the platform as well as specifying the requirements for modules and even the docking system. In case of the docking system, my advisor's thesis introduces connector to connector and connector to module communication (\TODO{which both persists to this day}), and the mechanical structure, which got improved over the proposed version.

Even though my advisor's thesis showcases prototype of the connector, that prototype differs a lot from the currently implemented one. The more up to date version of the connector is described in the paper ``RoFICoM -- First Open-Hardware Connector for Metamorphic Robots'' by Jan Mrázek and Jiří Barnat \cite{MrazekBarnat2019Roficom}.

In this thesis, the usage of ``prototype'' is used to address the project version before my thesis, and the usage of ``current'' (implementation or version) to describe the result project after my thesis.

% Establishing the problem
\TODO{Even though} the previous work creates the connector, the implementation is in work-in-progress state. The aim of this thesis is to enhance the firmware of the \acrshort{roficom} to production ready state by improving the prototype implementation and adding new features.

% Specifying objectives
The main objectives for this thesis are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implement distance measuring into \acrshort{roficom}. This includes implementation of \acrshort{i2c} driver and \TODO{integration} of the \gls{vl53l1x} driver.
    \item Propagate the measurements from \acrshort{roficom} to the \gls{universal-module}. 
    \item Port the prototype firmware for the \acrshort{roficom} to production-ready version of the hardware board.
    \item Change motor control in the firmware to use newly added magnetic sensors.
    \item Implement power control -- i.e., reading current and voltage on EXT and INT powerlines, charging accumulator from INT powerline and discharging the accumulator to the INT powerline.
\end{itemize}

% Paper structure
The structure of this paper starts with introduction to the \acrshort{rofi} platform and description of its components in chapter, which is followed by the overview of the prototype firmware implementation \TODO{and proposes what changes will be made}. After that, this thesis focuses on \TODO{three} main features implemented in this thesis. \TODO{Those features are distance measuring in the \acrshort{lidar} chapter \ref{sec:lidar}, \acrlong{bsp} for isolating board specific code and adapting changes in the board, and changes and updates of the \acrshort{rofi} \acrlong{hal}}. The last chapter focuses on other interesting implementations and their reasoning, followed by the conclusion of this thesis.

\chapter[ RoFI ]{ \acrshort{rofi} }
\TODOLIST{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Describe the platform
    \item Universal module
\end{itemize}
}

The \acrshort{rofi} is a platform of distributed self-reconfigurable modular robots developed at Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University.

The main goal of the \acrshort{rofi} platform is to provide a well-established open source and open-hardware platform for metamorphic robots. Thus both source-code and hardware schematics are provided publicly in the \TODO{ GitHub repository \footcite[\url{https://github.com/paradise-fi/RoFI}]{rofi-github} }. The primary use case for such platform is testing reconfiguring algorithms on a hardware platform and further research into this topic rather than \TODO{solving real-world problems}.

The basic building block is the \acrshort{rofi} module, which is an individual module that can connect and communicate with other modules. A \TODO{flock} of connected \acrshort{rofi} modules makes a \emph{\gls{rofibot}}. A specific example of the \acrshort{rofi} module is the \gls{universal-module}.


\section[ Universal Module ]{ \gls{universal-module} }
\TODOLIST{
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ESP32
        \item SPI
        \item UART
        \item accumulator
        \item EXT and INT power lines
        \item 3 motors
        \item 6 docks
    \end{itemize}
}
\gls{universal-module} \glsdesc{universal-module} The \gls{universal-module} is not designed as an all-in-one module but rather as a module with minimal \TODO{necessary features} that can be used in nearly all systems. Thus, the \gls{universal-module} uses only two sensors: an \emph{inertial measurement unit} (IMU) and a \emph{distance sensor} (\acrshort{lidar}). If specific sensors are needed, it is expected to use them as own modules.

An inertial measurement device measures the unit's acceleration, angular velocity and orientation. The measured data can be used in algorithms coordinating the modules.

The distance sensor (\acrshort{lidar}) is placed in the middle of each dock and is described in detail in its own chapter \ref{sec:lidar}. The \acrshort{lidar} measures the distance from the dock to an obstacle or a surface, or to help align docks when connecting. The \acrshort{lidar} can scan the environment. Scanning environment can be useful when the \gls{rofibot} needs to walk up stairs, or in general needs to know about its surroundings.

The module is divided into four components: two bodies and two shoes. The main purpose of shoes is to establish connections with other modules and provide movement. Each shoe contains three docks and \TODO{one joint}. In comparison, the body encloses actuators, electronics, and accumulators. There is one last \TODO{joint} between the two bodies. In total, the module contains six docks, three \TODO{joints/motors} and two types of sensors.

\todo{Insert image of \gls{universal-module}}

\subsection{ Architecture }

The docks used in the \gls{universal-module} are called \acrshortpl{roficom}. The \acrshort{roficom} is in detail described and explained in the next section \ref{sec:roficom}.

Each module has a single \emph{control unit} that serves as a centralized control over the actions of the module and all the module's components. The motors are controlled through UART protocol, and the docks are controlled over SPI protocol. The control unit also controls charging and power management.

\acrlong{roficom}, \acrshort{roficom} for short, is an open-hardware connection system designed for the \acrshort{rofi} platform. \acrshort{roficom} focuses on reusability \TODO{in order to make it easily integrable} into any module for which \acrshort{roficom} provides
communication to other modules. As the name suggests, its primary purpose is to (inter)connect modules. In order to achieve its purpose, the \acrshort{roficom} has a well-defined interface that can be divided into three parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item mechanical structure,
    \item connector-to-connector interface (communication between two \acrshortpl{roficom}),
    \item connector-to-module interface (communication with the integrated module).
\end{itemize}

\fi

RoFICoM is built from three main parts: \emph{body}, \emph{clip} and \emph{skirt}. These three parts are shown in figure \ref{ fig:key-components }

\begin{figure}
    %responsive_image path: assets/img/connector/dock_key_components.svg 
    \includegraphics{ dock_key_components.pdf }
    \caption{ \TODO{ Visual representation of main components } \TODO{Add citation} }
    \label{ fig:key-components }
\end{figure}

The body is a non-movable part that is mounted into the module.
The clip and skirt are the most important parts for establishing strong mechanical connections between two \acrshortpl{roficom}.
The clip component consists of four latches attached to a ring. Those latches get attached while connecting with
other \acrshort{roficom}. While expanding, the clip gets rotated and expanded upward by the motor. In the process, the latches on the mating
side slide under each other, therefore forming a mechanical connection that prevents connectors from being pulled apart.
However, the latches themselves are insufficient for a mechanical connection, as a mutual rotation of the connectors releases
the connection. This is why the skirt is needed. Two connected skirts stop the rotation against each other.

In order to help ease the process of connection, there are magnets placed in the holes of skirt. This helps when two connecting sides are slightly misaligned.

The motor that rotates the clip and the skirt are located at the bottom of the body. The rotation of the clip and the skirt is accomplished by another component the shaft ring. The shaft ring is connected to the clip and has a bevel gearing (stair like ramp) connected to the motor. When the motor activates, it rotates the shaft ring and moves among the gearing elevating the components. The motor in the body and clip shaft with a bevel gearing is shown in the figure \ref{ fig:dock-arrangement }.

-->
\fi

A small printed circuit board (PCB) inside skirt with spring-loaded pins realizes the connector-to-connector connection. This PCB provides both
data and power sharing to the connected module.
\acrshort{roficom} uses \textbf{UART} transferring frames with specified format and CRC for data communication. Those frames hold ``blobs'' --
binary data that is transferred between modules.

    \includegraphics{ skirt_pins.pdf }
    \caption{ \TODO{Graph showing pin layout on PCB inside the skirt} }
\end{figure}

\subsection{ Connector to Module Interface }
RoFICoM provides an \textbf{SPI} interface for communication between the module and RoFICoM. The communication on the bus is performed
in transactions. Transaction format consists of \textbf{command}, which is the first 8 bits of a transaction, followed by \textbf{command
data}, then at least 8 bytes pause with connector response. Commands \numrange{0}{127} are reserved for the base connector and are required to be supported by all
connector types. For example, some connector commands are version command, status command, send and receive earlier
mentioned blob.

\subsection{ Motivation of RoFICoM }
<!--
_Requirements_:
- able to connect when docks are not touching side by side
- genderless
- connection in four different orientations
- based on a mechanical connection
- disconnect without the participation of the mating side
- support data and power-sharing
-->

Since the RoFI platform is [grid-based]({% link _platform/01_grid-system.md %}), it results in several _requirements_
for both the platform and, more importantly for us, the docking system.
In order to answer "Why do we need it?" let's walk through the _requirements_, their cause and how RoFICoM implements them.

<!-- The first _requirement_ is to **allow modules to connect
when they are not touching side by side**, which is caused by the modules being sphere-shaped, resulting in an empty gap between two adjacent modules. RoFICoM solves this by having a [flat design with expanding and retracting](#mechanical-structure) as it connects and disconnects, respectively. -->
RoFICoM has a flat design with ability to expand and retract. This allows RoFICoM to connect over empty space between
adjacent modules. As result modules don't have to be physically touching to be able to connect.

<!-- The _requirement_ of a **genderless** docking system and the **ability to connect in four different orientations** are to limit the
complexity of configuration and reconfiguration. RoFICoM solves this by being 90-degree symmetrical (see figure below). -->
RoFICoM has 90-degree symmetrical design, this is best seen in figure below on the skirt design. Therefore it enables
RoFICoM to connect in **four different orientations** (0°, 90°, 180°, 270°) and makes the connector **genderless**.

{% responsive_image path: assets/img/connector/skirt_symmetry.svg max_width: "450px" title: "Top down look of skirt symmetry" %}

RoFICoM forms **strong mechanical connection** using previously mentioned clip and skirt. This feature not only helps RoFICoM stay connected under pressure, but also remain connected without electricity consumption or to avoid limitations of magnetic force.

{% responsive_image path: assets/img/connector/locking_process.svg max_width: "450px" title: "Visualization of roficom's locking process." %}

<!-- It is required to be able to **disconnect without the participation of the mating side** to ease reconfiguration. On top of
that, this allows for connection to passive docks. RoFICoM solves this with its mechanical design of the clip and skirt.
The design enables the connector to expand/retract and thus connect to/disconnect from the mating side independently
of the other side. -->
RoFICoM is designed . This design is accomplished by the clip and skirt, which enables **connection between mating sides** to be established **independently of each other**. Additionally this enables the RoFICoM to connect to passive docks.

Last but not least, the docking system must **support data and power
sharing**, which is used to coordinate and charge modules. RoFICoM solves this with a [connector-to-connector
interface](#connector-to-connector-interface).

\subsection{ Hardware details }
\TODOLIST{
\begin{itemize}
    \item MCU
    \item motor
    \item UART
    \item SPI
    \item \acrshort{i2c}
    \item EXT and INT power lines
\end{itemize}
}

\acrshort{roficom} is actually split into two boards: \TODO{skirt connector} and \TODO{??system board??}. Those two boards are connected with a cable connecting the pins on two boards. The skirt connector board holds \acrshort{lidar} and pins for connector-to-connector connection. Those pins are UART pins (TX -- transmit pis and RX -- receive pin), EXT and INT powerlines, and ``sense`` pins for detecting the orientation of the connection. The internal (INT) powerline can be used to charge the current module, or to charge connected modules from the current one. On the other hand, the external powerline is used only to connect the powerlines of other modules. There are four used pins for the \acrshort{lidar}: two pins for \acrshort{i2c} (SDA and SCL explained in \ref{sec:i2c}), the \acrshort{lidar} enable pin and the \acrshort{lidar}'s interrupt pin. The skirt connector is placed in the middle of the skirt, thus, moving together with the skirt.

\TODO{system board} contains all other necessary circuits for \acrshort{roficom} to function. It consists of the board's microcontroller, motor, power connections, power management, reading current and voltage from power lines, and SPI interface needed for the connector to module interface. That being said, the circuit for reading current is not attached at the moment.

% \TODO{ Missing pins and a change in the motor's limit led to the change of MCU }

The magnetic sensors for the motor's retraction and expansion limit could not detect and stop the movement of the motor fast enough, which damaged the \acrshort{roficom}'s case.
As for the magnetic sensors, instead of two pieces, they got increased to an array of ten pieces along the motor's movement path to determine the motor's speed and position more precisely.

The \acrshort{roficom} has microcontroller STM32G071CBUx from the STMicroelectronics. This microcontroller from the STM32G0 family is a high-performance ARM Cortex-M0+ processor. The main features of this microcontroller are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A maximum clock frequency of \qty{64}{\mega\hertz},
    \item The biggest size of flash memory currently in embedded microcontrollers of \qty{128}{\kilo\byte},
    \item Static RAM of size \qty{36}{\kilo\byte},
    \item 48 pins.
\end{itemize}

The microcontroller has other functionality, such as CRC calculation, SPI, UART, \acrshort{i2c} and many more.

}

This chapter focuses on the software of the \acrshort{rofi} platform, and describes both the state of software in the prototype implementation and the changes in the current implementation.

% \section{ Project Structure / Architecture}
The \acrshort{rofi} repository is an enormous monolithic (mostly) \verb|c++| project and contains many \acrshort{rofi} related sub-projects. For this thesis, only several sub-projects are essential. Those sub-projects are the \acrshort{roficom}'s firmware, stm32 drivers and \acrshort{rofi} HAL.

\TODO{Need more introduction or depth description of the strucutre ??}

\section[ RoFICoM's Firmware ]{ \acrshort{roficom}'s Firmware }
\acrshort{roficom}'s firmware is located in the repository at the path \path{RoFI/hardwareModules/RoFICoM/software/control_board/}.

The prototype version had several needed features implemented. Those features were the \lstinline|spiInterface| (the connector to module interface), \lstinline|connInterface| (the connector to connector interface) and motor control. However, since the motor control could not stop the motor fast enough and the magnetic sensors for detecting the motor position changed, \TODO{the motor control firmware needed an update too}. \TODO{However,} the \lstinline|connInterface| is not fully implemented, in the prototype it is missing sending all the information defined by the protocol. \TODO{Due to the addition of lidar the protocol needed to be extended.}

\TODO{Protocol -- here or in connector to connector interface}

\section{ Stm32 Drivers }
\TODOLIST{
\begin{itemize}
    \item already implemented
    \item port files -- portability
    \item to implement -- \acrshort{i2c}
\end{itemize}
}

The \lstinline|stm32cxx| sub-project abstracts and wraps around the bare 
\verb|C| stm32 drivers into nicer \verb|c++| \TODO{classes}. This abstraction allows using the drivers without explicitly handling family specific code, and provides easier and prettier usage rather than using the \verb|C| drivers.

The port files of the \lstinline|stm32cxx| handles the portability, or the MCU family specific code. \TODO{Port files explanation here? -- or in design decisions}

The prototype version had \TODO{many drivers, that were needed, implemented}, such as drivers for GPIO, UART, SPI and more. The current implementation mainly added the driver for \acrshort{i2c} and some smaller additions, namely timer counter and blocking wait for time, and missing family specific definitions.

\section[ RoFI HAL ]{ \acrshort{rofi} HAL }
\TODOLIST{
\begin{itemize}
    \item ROFI HAL interface -- prototype vs changes
    \item ROFI HAL implementation esp32    
\end{itemize}
}

\acrlong{hal}, or \acrshort{hal} for short, is part of the \acrshort{rofi} platform that provides an abstraction over the running platform, which can be real hardware or a simulator. It can also be used as an abstraction over different \acrshort{rofi} hardware -- modules with motors, sensors and more -- without changing the user firmware. Therefore, \acrshort{rofi} \acrshort{hal} aims to define a solid and compact interface to make both -- the implementation and the usage simpler.

The \acrshort{rofi} \acrshort{hal} is divided into \emph{interface} and \emph{implementation}. Every change that breaks the previous interface version is costly, because that change needs to be reflected in every implementation, which can be a lot. For example, implementation for each module with specific sensor, motor and multiple simulators. However, due to the addition of \acrshort{lidar}, \TODO{the interface needs an update to reflect this addition}.

The prototype had implementations for esp32 and simulator. The esp32 are the implementation for the \gls{universal-module}.

\end{itemize}
}
This chapter describes \acrshort{lidar} and its capabilities, how to use the \gls{vl53l1x} \acrshort{lidar}, which includes communicating with the \gls{vl53l1x} over the bus and using the \gls{vl53l1x} driver provided by the manufacturer. The last section ?describes? the current implementation of the \acrshort{lidar} driver, which is \verb|c++| class abstracting the usage of the \gls{vl53l1x} driver.  

\acrshort{lidar}, which stands for \acrlong{lidar}, is a device that measures range. \acrshort{lidar} uses laser and time, in which the light travels to an object or a surface and bounces back to determine the distance. Thus, the results of this technique is very dependant on the ambient light in the measured environment. As such, the \acrshort{lidar} is not only used for measuring the distance from an object but also for \emph{3-D scanning}. 3-D scanning is \TODO{collecting data about the real world environment} into a digital representation. Many industries use \acrshort{lidar}, one of the most known use cases might be in NASA's Mars helicopter Ingenuity \cite{garmin-lidar}.

\acrshort{roficom} uses \gls{vl53l1x} \acrshort{lidar} from STMicroelectronics. This specific \acrshort{lidar} has the following main features: (All features and description can be found in the part's datasheet \cite{vl53l1x}.)

\begin{itemize}
    \item the ability to accurately measure the range between \qty{4}{\centi\metre} and \qty{4}{\metre},
    \item up to \qty{50}{\hertz} ranging frequency,
    \item single \qty{2.8}{\volt} power supply,
    \item \acrshort{i2c} communication interface with up to \qty{400}{\kilo\hertz} speed,
    \item shutdown and interrupt pins. (However, these pins are not necessary.)
\end{itemize}

Even though \acrshort{lidar} accurately measures the range between \qty{4}{\centi\metre} and \qty{4}{\metre}, it also measures distances below and above this range, although the measured distance does not have to be accurate. The lidar library, which \acrshort{roficom} uses, deals with inaccuracy by reporting the status of measured data, which is explained later on.

The shutdown pin is used to reset the \acrshort{lidar} by software. That being said, on the actual hardware, the pin is inverted, which results in behavior more similar to enable pin, i.e., the device is enabled when the bus with a shutdown pin is driven high and the device shuts down when the bus is driven low. This pin does not have to be controlled by software. However, in that case, it still has to be connected to the power supply through a pull-up connector, \TODO{which was the case in the \acrshort{roficom} version 0.6}.

On the other hand, the interrupt pin does not require to be connected. This pin signals that the new distance was measured and must be cleared before the next measurement. When the pin is not connected, it is never driven high, and thus the device is in always ready-to-measure state, which can result in missing measurements when the data is not received at the correct time.

The alternative to the interrupt signal is polling. Polling means that the firmware asks the \acrshort{lidar} periodically whether the measurement data are ready to be transmitted. However, if the period is too long, it is possible to miss some measured data. For example, if the inter-measurement timing (the time between two measurements) was \qty{100}{\milli\second} and the firmware's asking period was \qty{500}{\milli\second}, the firmware could miss four measurements from the \acrshort{lidar}. \TODO{Polling was used with \acrshort{roficom} version 0.6 because the MCU did not have available pins for the interrupt pin. Whereas the \acrshort{roficom} version 1.0 is connected and uses the interrupt pin.}

\section{ Communication }
This section describes details communication with the \gls{vl53l1x} -- i.e., protocol used for communication and how the protocol works, usage of protocol in \gls{vl53l1x}, and the current \acrshort{i2c} implementation for the \gls{vl53l1x} driver. 

\gls{vl53l1x} uses the \acrshort{i2c} communication protocol. The next subsection describes this protocol, if you are familiar with the protocol you can continue to subsection \ref{sec:lidar-i2c}.

\subsection[ Inter-Integrated Circuit Protocol ]{ \acrlong{i2c} Protocol } \label{sec:i2c}
\acrshort{i2c}, which stands for \acrlong{i2c}, is a protocol designed for communication between a controller (or more controllers) and multiple peripheral devices. The protocol requires only two lines: SDA (serial data) and SCL (serial clock). Both lines are open-drain with pull-up resistors, which means that the bus driver can drive the bus line low but cannot drive it high. This constrain prevents the collision  driving the line both high and low, which would damage the drivers.

The protocol's communication is done in 8-bit packets. The transaction starts with the start condition. After that, every packet is confirmed from the receiving side with one acknowledgment bit, and the transaction ends with the stop condition. Since more peripheral devices can be connected to the \acrshort{i2c} bus, the controller must first address the peripheral to communicate.

The address of a peripheral is either a 7-bit or 10-bit number, where the 10-bit address must be split into two packets with a specified format. The reason why the address is only 7-bit and not the full 8-bits of the packet is because the last bit indicates the transaction type. The transaction type is either read transaction (the bit is set to 0) or write transaction (the bit is set to 1). The read/write bit is the least significant bit of the packet, and the address in contained in the seven highest bits of the packet (i.e. the address is shifted left by one bit). After the address is sent and met with acknowledgment from the peripheral, the data begins to be transmitted. \TODO{The protocol allows for any length of the data to be transmitted.}

The start condition is when the controller drives the SDA line low before the SCL goes down. Stop condition is when the controller releases SDA (the line goes from low to high) \textbf{after} the SCL line changed to high. It is suggested not to change the SDA line while SCL is high to avoid signaling false stop conditions during data transmission. Note that the acknowledgment bit is negated, i.e., logical 0 on the bus line signals that the peripheral received the packet successfully, whereas logical 1 signals the opposite.

\TODO{This protocol has several advanced topics, such as 10-bit addresses, repeated start conditions, and clock stretching, which are not needed to understand this thesis.}

\TODO{Should I write about advanced topics? or at least 10-bit addresses?}

\subsection{ \TODO{Difference in lidar} } \label{sec:lidar-i2c}
Even though the \gls{vl53l1x} uses \acrshort{i2c} protocol, there is a small but significant change in communication. \gls{vl53l1x} not only uses an \acrshort{i2c} address but also requires the address of its register, which is a 16-bit number and \textbf{must} be the first two data packets. The most significant byte of this index is sent first, followed by the least significant byte. Sending the index applies to both types of transactions (read and write). That means that in order to read data from the \acrshort{lidar}, the controller needs to make two transactions: first, a write transaction with register index, and second with the actual read. However, writing data to the \acrshort{lidar} makes only one write transaction because the index and data \textbf{must} be written together in one transaction.

\section{ \TODO{Protocol / API} }
Even though \gls{vl53l1x} has clearly defined read and write operations, there is no public specification of how to control the \acrshort{lidar}, i.e. how to initialize the \acrshort{lidar}, start measuring and request the measured data. STMicroelectronics provides and recommends using their software API, in a form of a software driver, to control the \acrshort{lidar}. The driver is a C library and is dual licensed under STMicroelectronics' proprietary license and under BSD 3-clause license, which is compatible with \acrshort{rofi}'s MIT license.

STMicroelectronics provides three driver versions: Full API (standard), \acrlong{uld} (\acrshort{uld}) and Ultra Low Power (ULP). The full API, or standard, driver implements a plethora of functionality together with errors and error messages. The \acrlong{uld} strips down the API only to necessary functionality and calibration, which can be removed if the space is needed. The Ultra Low Power driver aims for the lowest power usage possible.

The \acrlong{uld} was selected for the \acrshort{roficom} because the full API was too large for the firmware. The size of the full api driver's release build took up to \qty{19}{\kilo\byte} of the MCU's Flash. In comparison the release build of \acrlong{uld} takes only \qty{1}{\kilo\byte}. This resulted in missing errors and error messages that was previously used with the full API driver. The \acrshort{uld} only reports failures either caused by lidar (signified as value $1$) or from the under-laying layer (\acrshort{i2c} communication). But in both cases we lose the error message. \todo{How to solve this error handling}.

\section[ API of the Ultra Lite Driver ]{ API of the \acrlong{uld} } \label{sec:lidar-api}
Because the \acrshort{uld} API is platform independent, it requires the user to implement \acrshort{i2c} communication for the platform (the implementation of \acrshort{i2c} in \acrshort{roficom} is described in section \ref{sec:lidar-i2c-impl}). The UM2510 \cite{um2510} manual explains how to use the \acrshort{uld} API and will be described in this section.

The flow of communication is following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Wait for successful boot of the \acrshort{lidar}.
    
    \item Initialize the \acrshort{lidar}.
    
    \item  Set optional settings for the \acrshort{lidar}, such as changing the \acrshort{lidar}'s \acrshort{i2c} address, changing the distance mode, changing timings for measurements, \TODO{\&c}.
    
    \item Start ranging, i.e. start measuring the data.
    
    \item Wait for the data to be ready -- either by polling or by interrupt.
    
    \item Receive the data from \acrshort{lidar}.
    
    \item Prepare for next ranging -- clear the interrupt flag.
    
    \item Either repeat step $5.$ or stop the measuring.
\end{enumerate}

\todo{Insert API flow diagram}

\subsection{ Error Handling }

Since the \acrshort{uld} is a C \TODO{library} the error reporting is the returned value from every API function. \TODO{When results other then errors are needed, those are provided as an ``out'' argument, i.e., pointer to the given variable.}

The error type (\lstinline[breaklines=false]|typedef int8_t VL53L1X_ERROR;|) for the \acrshort{uld} is 8-bit signed integer. The full API driver defines error values among the definition of the error type, however, this is not the case for the \acrshort{uld}. Even though the \acrshort{uld} does not specify error codes, the code for no error is defined to be $0$. Although the \acrshort{uld} usually returns errors from the underlying \acrshort{i2c} communication, in some cases the \acrshort{uld} sets the error to value $1$.

Thus, the typical error handling of the \acrshort{uld} API calls look like the following code listing:

\begin{lstlisting}[float, caption={Structure of error handling of the \acrshort{uld} function calls.}, captionpos=b]
VL53L1X_ERROR status;
status = VL53L1X_SensorInit( ... );
if (status != 0) {
    ... // Report error
    return status;
}

status = VL53L1X_StartRanging( ... );
if (status != 0) {
    ...
    return status;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{ Distance Modes } \label{distance-modes}

\gls{vl53l1x} has 3 distance modes: \emph{short}, \emph{medium} and \emph{long}. Since the \acrshort{lidar} depends on ambient light, this is when distance modes makes difference. Even though short mode can measure only up to \qty{136}{\centi\metre} it is not as impacted by the ambient light as other modes. In datasheet \cite{vl53l1x} is mentioned that the short distance mode can measure \qty{135}{\centi\metre} under strong ambient light, which is nearly the same as without ambient light. In contrary, the medium and long modes are impacted by the ambient light. Whereas the long mode can measure up to \qty{360}{\centi\metre}, in the strong ambient light it only measured \qty{73}{\centi\metre}.

The \acrshort{uld} provides only two distance modes: short and long. Those modes are described in \ref{distance-modes}. The representation for modes are \lstinline|1| for the short mode, and \lstinline|2| for the long mode. The \acrshort{uld} provides functions \lstinline|VL53L1X_SetDistanceMode()| and \lstinline|VL53L1X_GetDistanceMode()| to set and retrieve current \acrshort{lidar} distance mode.

\subsection{ Timings }

\todo{ Insert timings diagram }

\subsection{ Timing Budget } \label{TB}

\emph{Timing budget} is the time that \acrshort{lidar} measures the distance. \TODO{ Longer timing budget increases the maximum distance \acrshort{lidar} can measure and improves the repeatability error}, but comes at cost of increasing the power consumption. The user can set the timing budget, which is in range from \qtyrange{20}{1000}{\milli\second}. There are few constrains on the timing budget. The minimal budget timing that can be used for all distance modes is \qty{33}{\milli\second}, however the short distance can use lower timings. In order to be able to measure \qty{4}{\metre} in the long distance mode, the timing budget must be at least \qty{140}{\milli\second}.

For the \acrshort{uld}, there is a difference in allowed values \TODO{compared} to the timing budget in the datasheet \cite{vl53l1x}. The allowed values for timing budget in the \acrshort{uld} are only $[15, 20,
33, 50, 100, 200, \qty{500}{\milli\second}]$. \TODO{However the \qty{15}{\milli\second} timing can be only used for the short distance mode}. The default value is set to \qty{100}{\milli\second}.

\subsection{ Inter-Measurement Period }
\emph{Inter-measurement} period is the time between the consecutive measurements. Therefore the inter-measurement period must be longer than the timing budget. The inter-measurement period is also programmable by the user.

The inter-measurement period must be longer than the timing budget. However, the \acrshort{uld} does not validate this and it is left to the user to assure. Otherwise the actual inter-measurement period would be double the expected value. The default value is set to \qty{100}{\milli\second}.

\subsection{ Result Structure } \label{sec:lidar-result}
\TODO{Describe Result structure.}

\begin{lstlisting}
typedef struct {
    uint8_t Status;
    uint16_t Distance;
    uint16_t Ambient;
    uint16_t SigPerSPAD;
    uint16_t NumSPADs;
} VL53L1X_Result_t;
\end{lstlisting}

\TODO{
Most important result is the measured \lstinline|Distance| in \unit{\milli\metre} together with the \lstinline|Status| of the measured distance.
}

\paragraph{\TODO{Status}}

The \acrshort{uld} manual \cite{um2510} documents only five statuses even though, the \gls{vl53l1x} datasheet \cite{vl53l1x} specifies eight. The five statuses with their corresponding values are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Valid (0)
    \item Sigma failure (1)
    \item Signal failure (2)
    \item Out of bounds (4)
    \item Wraparound (7)
\end{itemize}

The range status of $0$ indicates successful measurement with the measurement data being ready to use.

The sigma failure with value $1$ means that the standard deviation of the measurements had surpassed the expected (normal) values, thus resulting in error. This error can fixed by increasing the timing budget.

The signal failure with value $2$ is caused by \acrshort{lidar} measuring weak signal. The signal rate is represented as a amplitude of the reflected signal from the target. This failure can happen when the target is too far, or is not reflective enough or there is no target at all. Since increasing the timing budget increases the maximum measurable distance it can eliminate this status, but does not have to.

The out of bounds with value $4$ usually occurs when the target is at the maximum possible measurable distance (and it is a very bright target). Subsequently, the measured results may be inconsistent.

The ``wraparound'' range status of value $7$ is reported when the target is very reflective and the distance is longer that the physical limited distance measurable by the \acrshort{lidar}. This distance is \qty{1.3}{\metre} for the short distance mode and \qty{5}{\metre} for the long mode.

\section{ \TODO{ \acrshort{lidar} driver abstraction in \acrshort{roficom} } }

Because most of the \acrshort{roficom} project is using \verb|c++| abstraction, I wanted to do the same for the \acrshort{lidar}. Moreover, the \acrshort{lidar} was designed as independent library from the \acrshort{roficom} firmware. \TODO{However, the \acrshort{lidar} library depends on the \texttt{stm32cxx} drivers.} The main goal for this driver is to make pleasant abstraction around the actual \verb|C| driver. Having the \acrshort{lidar} driver abstraction enables to change or update the underlying driver without more or less changing the \acrshort{roficom}'s firmware. The \acrshort{lidar} was designed to keep similar communication flow as with the \verb|C| driver (as described in section \ref{sec:lidar-api}). \TODO{The \acrshort{lidar} is supposed to be \emph{hot-pluggable}, that means it can be inserted or removed at any time without restarting or crashing the system.} Since the \acrshort{lidar} itself does not have to be plugged in the \acrshort{roficom}, I wanted to make the handling of the \acrshort{lidar} state little more explicit. The states are -- \acrshort{lidar} is not present, \acrshort{lidar} is present but not yet initialized, \acrshort{lidar} is initialized but not measuring, and last, \acrshort{lidar} is measuring. 

\subsection{Error handling}
Managing state goes in hand with error handling since every operation can fail by either \acrshort{i2c} failing, \verb|C| driver failing or simply by the fact the \acrshort{lidar} is not plugged in. Before considering the error handling it is important to mention that the operations of \acrshort{lidar} differs in returned value. For example, some function returns the distance mode, the measurement result, or in most cases, they do not return any value; however, all of them can fail.

There are several choices for considering error handling in \verb|c++|. The first choice that comes to mind are exceptions. However, they are not suitable for embedded programming due to the overhead they bring, and thus cannot be used. Another solution might be returning error, and passing in other return values as output argument (e.g. pointer or reference). This solution has mainly two issues. The first issue is that every function call needs to be checked explicitly whether it succeeded or not, significantly cluttering the code. The second issue is that \TODO{for each return value we need variable in the caller function.} This complicates the code, for example consider what needs to be done to check whether the measured data are ready to receive from the \acrshort{lidar}. Firstly, we need to create \lstinline|bool| in the current scope, that will hold the readiness of the \acrshort{lidar}, then we call the function to get the readiness, after that we must check whether anything failed, and if not we can finally check whether the data is ready or not. This produces code which is much more complicated then having simple check in the form \lstinline[breaklines=false]|if (lidar.getMeasurementDataReady()) {...}|.

\verb|c++23| contains new mechanism for error handling the \lstinline|std::expected|, which is similar to the Rust's \lstinline|Result| or Haskell's \lstinline|Either|. However, at the time of writing the project is using \verb|c++20| since not all the features of \verb|c++23| are yet implemented in used compilers. Fortunately, the \acrshort{rofi} project contains implement of the concept under the name \lstinline|Result| under the Atoms project. Atoms are helper libraries for the \acrshort{rofi} project and the \lstinline|Result| can be found under the path \path{RoFI/softwareComponents/atoms/include/atoms/result.hpp}.

The \lstinline|Result| contains either \emph{value} or \emph{error}. The \lstinline|Result| cannot contain both. It is similar to the \lstinline|std::optional|, although contains more information about the error. Both the value and error can be any \TODO{type}. The \lstinline|Result| provides ability to check whether the result contains value or error (with either \lstinline|bool| operator or \lstinline|has_value()| method), receive the underlying value or error, and \emph{monadic functions}. If you are not familiar with monadic functions, they allows you to work on the wrapped value (i.e., value or error in the case of \lstinline|Result|) rather than the \lstinline|Result| itself. Those functions save us from the constant checking whether the result contains value or error. The monadic functions for the \lstinline|Result| are \lstinline|and_then()|, \lstinline|or_else()| and \lstinline|transform()|. The \lstinline|and_then()| method applies its argument (callable function) on the value of the \lstinline|Result| only if the value is present, otherwise it returns the error. Similarly, the \lstinline|or_else()| returns value if it contains value, otherwise returns result of its argument (again callable function). The \lstinline|transform()| and \lstinline|transform_error()| are used to transform the type of value or error respectively.

Even though the return value types differ for many functions, the error type is the same for all the function, \TODO{thus it is important choice}. The default error type for the \lstinline|Result| is \verb|c++|'s \lstinline|std::string|. However, \lstinline|std::string| is very robust and heavy library (in embedded context), which means it is not suitable for the firmware. Two alternatives were considered -- \lstinline|std::string_view| and base number (or a enum). The \lstinline|std::string_view| was chosen since it allows error detection when developing. However, all functions are implemented in a way to allow for easy error type change. Every functions returns the error wrapped by function \lstinline|errorMessage( error )|. The function \lstinline|errorMessage()| converts the bare error (in this case the error return by the \gls{vl53l1x} driver) to the \acrshort{lidar}'s error. Thus, when changing the error type for the \acrshort{lidar} only the \lstinline|error_type| member and the \lstinline|errorMessage| function needs to be changed.

\subsection{ Usage of the driver }

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \input{lidar-state.tex}
    \caption[Diagram of \acrshort{lidar}'s state]{\TODO{lidar state}}
    \label{fig:lidar-state}
\end{figure}

Since the current requirement on the \acrshort{lidar} is to always measure the distance, the firmware accounts for two states -- actively measuring and uninitialized (or unable to measure). The \verb|Measuring| in the figure above stays the same as the actively measuring. However, the state ``unable to measure'' is combined from states \verb|Missing|, \verb|Uninitialized| and \TODO{somewhat} \verb|Initialized|. These two new states makes state handling easier in the code. The state ``unable to measure'' is handled by the function \lstinline|lidarInit()|, and the state \verb|Measuring| is handled by \lstinline|lidarGet()|. The main purpose of \lstinline|lidarInit()| is to correctly initialize the device and start measuring. On the other hand, the function \lstinline|lidarGet()| expects the device to be correctly initialized and measuring. The purpose of \lstinline|lidarGet()| is to check whether the distance is measured, and if it is, save the measurements for the next transfer to the \TODO{module's esp32}.

Those two functions can call each other, because if anything fails in the process (in both functions), the device probably needs to be initialized again. In contrary, when the \lstinline|lidarInit()| succeeds it is safe to call \lstinline|lidarGet()|. \lstinline|lidarGet()| calls it self, to assure the latest measurements are saved. It is important to note, that not receiving the data (i.e., the data is not ready yet) is not failure, and only means it is necessary to check on the data again. Otherwise the measured value would never be received -- the device would get initialized again before the first measurement.

Nevertheless, the previous implementation would result in infinite indirect recursion, to avoid the recursion the current implementation uses \lstinline|IdleTask::defer()|. \lstinline|IdleTask| is class that provides scheduling function calls, the scheduled functions are called with \lstinline[breaklines=false]|IdleTask::run()|. The usage of scheduled function calls allows the firmware to schedule other routines in between the two lidar functions, and to handle necessary tasks, such as SPI communication.

\chapter[ Board Support Package ]{\acrlong{bsp}} \label{BSP}
\TODOLIST{
\begin{itemize}
    \item \acrshort{bsp} = providing i2c functions to \acrshort{lidar} library + easier portability
    \item \acrshort{bsp} = global namespace \lstinline{Gpio::Pin} initialization is **UB**
\end{itemize}
}

Most of the \TODO{development was done} on the prototype board but it was expected to move to the production-ready (current) version of the hardware board. This was important especially because the MCU's case changed, which resulted in pin changes and addition of magnetic sensors for the motor. Easier transition is accomplished by using \acrshort{bsp}.

\acrlong{bsp}, or \acrshort{bsp} for short, is a layer of abstraction specifying  \TODO{minimal needed hardware requirements} for the project, and procedures for board initialization. For example needed pins and peripherals, such as \acrshort{i2c}. 

\TODO{main benefit: single point of gpio definitions, peripheral initialization, ... - enables for easier portability}

The main benefit and use case for \acrshort{bsp} is having all board specific code in one place. The code typically used in \acrshort{bsp} is pin definitions, initialization routines and overall board initialization.

\acrshort{bsp} is usually used in embedded environment and provides many benefits. Not only it abstracts hardware details, but also it establishes single source of truth for pin definitions, which is less error prone than having them defined at multiple places. \acrshort{bsp} assures correct initialization of the board at single place. Having everything at single point enables for easier portability across different board versions. The abstraction allows for usage of the \TODO{bsp parts} in different independent parts of the project. 

In \acrshort{roficom}, \acrshort{bsp} is implemented as two files: \verb|bsp.hpp| and \verb|bsp.cpp|. The \verb|bsp.hpp| header file contains all declarations of pins and peripheral drivers, which live in namespace \lstinline{bsp} and are exposed for use in \acrshort{roficom}. However, the function \lstinline{bsp::setupBoard()} \textbf{must} be called before any pin or driver is accessed. The function \lstinline{bsp::setupBoard()} initialized the board, pins and drivers provided in the \lstinline{bsp} namespace. The header file provides declaration of function \lstinline{dbgInstance}, which is function that \acrshort{roficom} uses for debugging with a \TODO{ \texttt{uart} } driver. \verb|bsp.hpp| depends on external function \lstinline|SystemCoreClockUpdate()|, which is \TODO{platform-dependant function} that needs to be called after board clock has been setup. \TODO{In contrary}, the \verb|bsp.cpp| defines and implements everything declared in \verb|bsp.hpp|. 

\verb|bsp.hpp| acts as an interface specifying what drivers and pins \acrshort{roficom} needs to function, however since those pins and drivers are stored as global variables in namespace \lstinline{bsp}, the interface should be kept as minimal as possible to save space in the global space. On the other hand \verb|bsp.cpp| acts as implementation of this interface and should mainly correctly setup the board, pins and drivers for usage, that means the \verb|bsp.cpp| can use pins and drivers that are not exposed as it needs to meet the interface specification.

To illustrate the main benefit of the \acrshort{bsp}, imagine scenario, where we need to change MCU on the board, thus changing pin layout. In this scenario we would only need to change the \verb|bsp.cpp| file with pin definitions (and if not already present implementation of drivers), but the \verb|bsp.hpp| and components built on top of that would be left unchanged and still work.

\section[ Gpio::Pin Initialization ]{ \lstinline|Gpio::Pin| Initialization }
\lstinline{Gpio::Pin} initialization is the most notable and important change in \lstinline{bsp} that differs from all other uses in \acrshort{roficom}. \acrshort{roficom} uses the expression \lstinline{GpioA[ 9 ]} to specify used pins. \lstinline{GpioA}, \lstinline{GpioB} and \lstinline{GpioC} are global objects provided by the \lstinline{Gpio} driver. At the time of writing, the initialization order of global variables across multiple translation unit is not defined by the language specification. As a result \lstinline{bsp} cannot use \lstinline{GpioA}, etc. for pin definitions and instead uses the \lstinline{Gpio::Pin} structure initialization, where first argument is the pin position and second argument is \TODO{the GPIO line defined by STMicroelectronics}.

    \item Changes done -- Added distance and status
\end{itemize}
}

The prototype version of the interface has all components as a \emph{Proxy}. Proxy object is meant to be an abstraction that does not hold the ownership of the underlying component. It is meant to be lightweight, safely copyable and shareable.

The prototype version contains three main components -- \lstinline|RoFI|, \lstinline|Joint| and \lstinline|Connector|. The \lstinline|RoFI| represents the \acrshort{rofi} module, this object does not have a constructor, and is instead received with \lstinline|RoFI::getLocalRoFI()| static method or \lstinline|RoFI::getRemoteRoFI(Id remoteId)|. Each module has its shape, which consists of number of joints and connectors the module. The \lstinline|RoFI| allows to get the proxy for the module's joints and connectors. The \lstinline|Joint| proxy allows for both control and \TODO{get joint information}.

The only component that needed change, due to the \acrshort{lidar} addition, was the connector. The \lstinline|Connector| proxy has ability to extend and retract the connector, connect and disconnect powerlines (internal or external), reaction to connection and disconnection from mating side and powerlines, and sending and reacting to received packets. The part of the \lstinline|Connector| that needed change was the \lstinline|ConnectorState|. The prototype version of the \lstinline|ConnectorState| contains information about the connector's position (extended or retracted), connection on powerlines and to the mating side, orientation of the connection (North, East, South, West), and the voltage and current of the powerlines.

The state was extended by the measured distance and the measurement status. However, this is different status that the \acrshort{lidar} status from \ref{sec:lidar-result}. Whereas, the measured distance is just 16-bit number with the measured distance in \unit{\mm}, the status is more complicated.

The status is 2-bit number with each value having assigned specific meaning. The status values and their meanings are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \lstinline|0b00| = Valid -- The measured distance is fully valid to use.
    \item \lstinline|0b01| = Out of Range -- The measured data was measured, however they \textbf{does not have to be valid}. Usually this means that the data are outside of the measurable range, however, it can also be caused by wrong settings.
    \item \lstinline|0b10| = Not Measured -- This status is when the \acrshort{lidar} is not plugged in, or the request was made before the first \acrshort{lidar} measurement was completed.
    \item \lstinline|0b11| = Error -- This signals error, which can be  \acrshort{i2c} communication error, \acrshort{lidar} error, or that the device got unplugged while communicating.  
\end{itemize}

This specific choice of values allows for the individual bits of the status to carry their own meaning, i.e. the higher bit acts as an inverted \emph{validity} bit (value \verb|1| means the measure data cannot be used), and the lower bit acts as a \emph{certainty} bit (value of \verb|0| means that measure distance should be correct). Note that the bit can be used as certainty bit only when the validity bit is set to valid. The \acrshort{lidar} status is for explicitness represented as a \lstinline|enum|.

\section{ Implementation -- esp32 }
\TODOLIST{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Apply changes from interface
    \item Issue $\rightarrow$ status is not being updated $\rightarrow$ Needed to implement poller
\end{itemize}
}

Since the protocol changed, the changes must be synchronized to all implementations. Not only does this change need to be replaced in all of the \acrshort{rofi} \acrshort{hal} implementations, but also in the firmware implementation. The change of firmware implementation that sends the \acrshort{lidar} status and measured distance is described in \TODO{add section reference}. This section describes changes made in the esp32 \acrshort{hal} implementation (for the \gls{universal-module}). \TODO{Other implementations are out of the scope of my work.}

The prototype version has a lot of functionality implemented. Before mentioning the specific changes made, there is short overview of how the esp32 \acrshort{hal} handles the connector-to-module communication. Any command, such as to connect, disconnect, are handled by the \lstinline|ConnectorBus| for the local connector. The connector schedules the command to be sent over the bus. The \lstinline|ConnectorBus| for sending the commands runs on parallel thread. The sent is handled by the function \lstinline|run()| with specified command as argument. After the command is sent and response is received, it is returned to the connector under the function call \lstinline|finish()|. The parsing of the response into the \lstinline|ConnectorState| is done with the function \lstinline|ConnectorStateImpl::from|.

The changes made to the esp32 implementation are addition of new flags of the protocol \TODO{(\acrshort{lidar} status)}. Followed by parsing the status response from the connector in the \lstinline|ConnectorStateImpl::from|, that contains the \acrshort{lidar} status and measured distance. As last, due to the change of size of the command, the change needs to be update in the \lstinline|ConnectorBus::run()|, but also in the dma buffer allocation of the \lstinline|ConnectorBus|.

\TODO{Needed poller}

Those changes are enough for getting the status and distance. However, the state is only updated, when status command is issued, this means that the state of status and distance does not represent current value. Updating the state was solved with poller. This poller runs in separate thread and periodically asks the \acrshort{roficom} to update the state. There must be a slight delay between commands to allow the \acrshort{roficom} for applying the commands and sending response. The poller is done by the FreeRTOS function \lstinline|xTaskCreate()|, that creates the new thread for polling, and constantly issues the command status.

\chapter{ Implementation -- Design Decisions }
This chapter walks over interesting design decisions and explains their reasoning.


\section{ Platform Dependant Code -- port files -- \TODO{CRPT} }
\TODOLIST{
\begin{itemize}
    \item comparison CRPT vs inheritance approach
    \item inheritance = vtables can introduce waste of space
\end{itemize}
}

To assure better portability the \verb|stm32cxx| drivers isolate processor family specific code into \emph{port} files. Under the path \path{RoFI/softwareComponents/stm32cxx/port/} are folders for family specific \TODO{abstraction}. The \verb|port| files are in the format \verb|{driver}.port.hpp|. For example the port file for \acrshort{i2c} for the microcontroller of \acrshort{roficom} is in \path{.../stm32cxx/stm32g0xx/i2c.port.hpp}.

Port files follows the same guidelines that the specific code in under \lstinline|namespace detail| and it is implemented via \emph{mixins}. However, since \verb|c++| does not natively support mixins, this is done using the \verb|c++| technique called CRTP. CRTP is a templated class, which takes the class we wish to extend with our mixin as template parameter, and implements the mixin functionality on the template class. Such functionality might be enabling clock for periphery or \TODO{setting alternative function on periphery pins}.

\section[ I2C driver ]{ \acrshort{i2c} driver }
\TODO{Secion intro}

The \acrshort{i2c} driver lies with other \verb|stm32| drivers in project at path \path{RoFI/softwareComponents/stm32cxx/src/drivers/}.

The driver contains class \lstinline|I2C|, \lstinline|SdaPin| and \lstinline|SclPin|, to make the pins distinguishable from \lstinline|Gpio::Pin| i.e., when constructing the \lstinline|I2C| the following construction, where \lstinline|pinSda| and \lstinline|pinScl| are \lstinline|Gpio::Pin|s, \lstinline|I2C(..., pinSda, pinScl)| would fail to compile. On the other hand the construction \lstinline|I2C(..., SdaPin( pinSda ), SclPin( pinScl ) )| compiles. It also ensures that swapping the two pin classes would not compile, i.e., \lstinline|I2C(..., SclPin( ... ), SdaPin( ... ) )| would not compile.

The \acrshort{i2c} driver provides two functions \lstinline|read| and \lstinline|write|. Those functions takes the \acrshort{i2c} address of the peripheral and data container. (There are also \lstinline|unsafe| variants of these functions that are used in \acrshort{lidar} \acrshort{i2c} implementation \ref{sec:lidar-i2c-impl} and takes raw buffer and its size instead of container.) Since the \lstinline|read| and \lstinline|write| are templated functions, they use private functions to actually implement \lstinline|read| and \lstinline|write|. These private functions are not templated and takes the raw buffer and size. Using slim templated function with inner function that is not templated reduces the size of generated functions from template, but allows the usage of generalized function.

\TODO{i2c implementation using stm32 tools ?}

\subsection{ Error handling }
Since the two functions only takes the arguments either for reading from or writing to the given argument, the functions are free to return anything. In this case they return error. Because the \acrshort{i2c} driver is used in \acrshort{lidar} \acrshort{i2c}, the error values are chosen in a mind to be compatible with error handling in the \acrshort{uld} \ref{uld}. The \acrshort{i2c} error enum has the following errors:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{Valid} value $0$ -- this is to be compatible with the \acrshort{lidar} error reporting,
    \item \emph{Reserved} $1$ -- Reserved for the error reported by the \TODO{todo ...},
    \item \emph{NotAcknowledge} = 2 -- The acknowledgment bit was not signalled after the 8 bits were transmitted,
    \item \emph{BusError} = 3 -- Bus error signals misplaced start or stop condition,
    \item \emph{ArbitrationLoss} -- Arbitration loss occurs when two masters starts transmitting at the same time,
    \item \emph{OverrunUnderrun} -- Overrun is when the newly sent 8-bits are read before the previous 8-bits were read, thus, resulting in data loss. On the other hand, Underrun is when the 8-bits are sent from the data register before the new 8-bits are written into the register, resulting in sending the same 8-bits of data second time,
    \item \emph{BufferOverflow} -- Buffer overflow happens when the receiving data are longer than the allocated buffer to store those data. The data are read until the end of the buffer and the error is reported.
\end{itemize}

\section{Protocol implementation}
\TODOLIST{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Added power information - connection of INT and EXT, current and voltage of INT and EXT.

\section{ Error Handling }

\section{ \TODO{??} }
\TODOLIST{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hard fault = ram had too high static usage, minimizing the usage by lower the number of available buckets for packets solved this (memory::pool)
\end{itemize}
}

\TODO{At one point} during the development the firmware started hard faulting on the \acrshort{roficom}. Hard faults are exceptions that are typically caused by unrecoverable system errors. Such errors can be an execution of an Undefined instruction, an attempted load or store to an unaligned address, and many more, which are described in more detail in the ARM Devices Generic User Guide.  This resulted in corrupted stack frames during debugging. \TODO{} The Fix to this issue was reducing the size of \TODO{pre-allocated} packet buffer. The count of 1025B buffers was reduced from \TODO{20} to \TODO{5}. \TODO{This seemingly fixed the issue.} 

\section{ \TODO{Size optimization} }
\TODOLIST{
\begin{itemize}
    \item Release build has over 107\% of MCU Flash
    \item `std::bind` -- `1,172B` vs Lambda `972B`
    \item using the \texttt{LL} stm32 drivers rather than HAL?
\end{itemize}
}

Function \lstinline|lidarGet()| tries to receive measurement results from the \acrshort{lidar} and assumes that the device is successfully initialized. This function takes a reference to the \lstinline|Lidar| class and variable to store in results. Because \lstinline|lidarGet()| is a polling function it needs to be called indefinitely to constantly update the currently measured distance. Due to the nature of polling, it is needed to poll only when \acrshort{roficom} is idle, otherwise constant polling \TODO{without ...}

\subsection[ Ultra Lite LiDAR Library ]{ Ultra Lite \acrshort{lidar} Library } \label{uld}

\chapter[ RoFICoM 1.0 ]{ \acrshort{roficom} 1.0 }
%% REMOVE:
New \acrshort{roficom} revision arrived needing firmware updates to reflect changes in hardware.

\TODOLIST{
Changes from version 0.6:
\begin{itemize}
    \item new MCU case with more pins: old = 29, new = 48 pins.
    \item due to a new case, several pins got changed
    \item \acrshort{lidar} changes: MCU pins for enable pin, interrupt pin
    \item Instead of 2 magnetic sensors as the limits of motor rotation, which didn't work quite enough, since the motor wasn't able to stop fast enough, version 2 has an array of 10 magnetic sensors to determine the speed and position of the motor in a more precise manner. 
\end{itemize}
}

On the previous revision, \acrshort{roficom}'s MCU (STM32G071GBU6) had only one last pin left unconnected. The old revision did not have connected \acrshort{lidar}'s enable pin, which meant there was no way to reset the \acrshort{lidar} from the firmware in case of a failure. The interrupt (IRQ) \acrshort{lidar} pin was also not connected in the old revision, but this was not an issue since it could have been solved by polling, as mentioned earlier in \TODO{Add a reference to the explanation of lidar usage}. 

The newly chosen MCU (STM32G071CBUx) has \TODO{48} pins in total, which is a considerable upgrade from the \TODO{29} pins \TODO{that had the previous} MCU. Even though several pins changed \TODO{something is missing here}, reflecting the new hardware revision in the firmware was not as hard because of the usage of \acrshort{bsp}, as explained in section \ref{BSP}. Furthermore, \acrshort{lidar}'s enable and interrupt pins got connected to the MCU's GPIO pins.
