  The RoFI platform is an open-software and open-hardware
  platform for modular robots. The RoFI platform uses the
  RoFI Communication Mechanism, RoFICoM for short, for
  connecting and communicating between two RoFI modules.

  This thesis presents an implementation of firmware for
  RoFiCoM. It is built on top an existing prototype
  implementation and transforms it into a production-ready
  state. We primarily introduce a board support package to
  support various hardware revisions and implement missing
  functionality, such as utilizing all on-board sensors and
  reworking motor control. Additionally, we enhance the
  communication protocol with support for these features and
  extend implementation for the Universal module's RoFICoM
  driver to support these changes.
